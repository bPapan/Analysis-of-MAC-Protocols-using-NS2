Simulated the wireless 802.11 (mobile) protocol and the wireless 802.15.4 (static) protocol on grid topologies of nodes. 
5 parameters have been varied:
  -Number of nodes
  -Number of flow
  -Number of packets per second
  -Velocity for mobile topology
  -Coverage area for static topology
  
A tcl file for a satellite network topology is also written which is a combination of a orbital satellite, some geo satellites and some wired nodes. 
Different metrics were measured varying the position of the orbital satellite.

Proposed a modification to the existing MAC802.11 protocol by changing some parameter value of the protocol.
Then the modified protocol is compared with the original 802.11 protocol. For each parameter under variation, the following metrics were observed:
  -Network throughput
  -End-to- end delay
  -Packet delivery ratio
  -Packet drop ratio
  -Total energy consumption
